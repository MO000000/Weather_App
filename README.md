# Weather_App

The Weather Website is one of my standout projects, showcasing my skills in API integration and responsive web design. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this website provides users with comprehensive weather updates for any city worldwide, covering three days: today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow.

Key features include:

1- 3-Day Weather Forecast: Displays the weather conditions for today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow for any location in the world.

2- Temperature Insights: Provides both the maximum and minimum temperatures over the three days.

3- Current Weather Conditions: Highlights the weather state (e.g., sunny, cloudy, or rainy) for each of the three days.

4- Responsive Design: Fully responsive, ensuring an excellent user experience across all devices.

This project highlights my ability to integrate APIs effectively and design a functional, visually appealing website to present real-time weather data to users worldwide.
